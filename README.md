This project is about an evacuation and rescue system for smart buildings. The objective is to increase people's survival rate in occurance of fire incidents. This is built on two steps: the first step provides routing for users who can exti
through safe entries, and the second step is to help trapped people by sending rescuers to the building. I leverages ANYlogic as an agent base simulator and coded most of the system fucitons in Java.
for more information on the system and results, please refer to this link: https://www.ej-eng.org/index.php/ejeng/article/view/2946

To run the simulation you need to install AnylogicPLE with workspace 8
