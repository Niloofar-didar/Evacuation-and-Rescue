This project focuses on an evacuation and rescue system for smart buildings with the objective of increasing people's survival rates during fire incidents. It involves two steps: the first step provides routing for users to exit through safe entries, and the second step helps trapped individuals by dispatching rescuers to the building. The system leverages ANYlogic as an agent-based simulator, and I coded most of the system functions in Java.

For more information on the system and results, please refer to this link:  https://www.ej-eng.org/index.php/ejeng/article/view/2946

To run the simulation you need to install AnylogicPLE with workspace 8

Here you can observe an screenshot of 3D simulation:
